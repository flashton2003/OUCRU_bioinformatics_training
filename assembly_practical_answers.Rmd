**Exercise 1**

Q1. ERR419108.2

Q2. 4.

Q3. 3.12.0

**Exercise 2**

Q4. 50 and 45 contigs, largest contigs are 255,441bp and 356,336bp, 486 Ns have been added in the scaffolded

**Exercise 3**

Q5. 2 separate graphs. This is the assembly of a whole chromosome and a plasmid.

Q6. The short nodes are often red, indicating a high coverage, while the long nodes are black. The short nodes are often repeat regions where we have assembled a single copy of a multi-copy repeat.

Q7. The nodes are all red, indicating that the plasmid is at higher copy number than the chromosome.

**Optional Exercise 4**

Q8. *K. pneumoniae* has 74 contigs and *M. tuberculosis* has 120 contigs. Both of them have more contigs than *S. aureus*.
