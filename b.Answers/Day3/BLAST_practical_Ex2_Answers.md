**Exercise 2**

Q1. Longest is pKST313 (300 kbp), shortest is FII-S1 (215 bp).

Q2. Sequences where the name starts with lowercase p are usually plasmids e.g. pSBLT or pKST313.

Q3. rpoB and ompD are usually chromosomal, all the others are plasmid associated

Q5. Itâ€™s hard to give a definite answer here, need to look at the assemblies of a variety of k-mers sizes to see. Is the graph still quite tangled, indicating that the max k-mer size was not long enough? Or were there too many dead ends, indicating that long k-mers were given more weight in the assembly than they should be.  But just an exercise to try and get people thinking about the effect of k-mer size on assembly. SRR5451253 looks good. SRR3285401 and SRR5451282 look a bit more tangled.
